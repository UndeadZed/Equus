# Autonomous Car project


this project is for generating a model of an autonomous car in a Udacity's car simulation using convolutional neural networks


# Motivation

I started this project to learn more about automation, simulation and neural networks

# Requirements

for this version you need to install the [udacity/self-driving-sim](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) it is also recommended that you install version 2 since it is the version that I have used for this project

it is also very important that you have all the [required libraries](https://github.com/UndeadZed/Equus/blob/main/git-Equus/requirements.txt) and that you install the simulation in the same directory as the code file

# How to Use

after extracting the simulation in the same file as the project create an empty file which you should name (Simulation_data) then run the simulation and select the Training mode
then select the (Simulation_data) folder then run the [training.py](https://github.com/UndeadZed/Equus/blob/main/git-Equus/training.py) file notice that this will take some time as it trains your model afterwards you'll see a file in the same directory by the name (Alastor.h5) this is your model so you only have to run the [training.py](https://github.com/UndeadZed/Equus/blob/main/git-Equus/training.py) once then open the simulation and select the map and select autonomous mode then run the [Test_model.py](https://github.com/UndeadZed/Equus/blob/main/git-Equus/Test_model.py) file which should run the simulation autonomously

# Credits

this model is based on Nvidia's End-to-End Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars which you can check from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/)

this was also inspired by [Murtaza Hassan's](https://github.com/murtazahassan) project on a similar subject

# Screenshots
I tested it in 2 maps to see how well the model generalized

Apparently it did generalize well although it wasn't as good as it was in the initial map

# Limitations
this project can only work on Udacity's simulation and cannot be used for real Autonomous Cars


# What's new

I have started working on the [CARLA Simulator](https://carla.org/) but it might take some time to finish because of all the exams and stuff


# [Carla Self driving car Simulation Project](https://github.com/UndeadZed/Equus/tree/main/git-Equus%20(CARLA)) 

check this out if you're looking for the CARLA Simulation Project


# Future updates

The next version will use [CARLA Simulator](https://carla.org/) and will have a more updated and specific architecture for the model that it generates which will hopefully produce better predictions and results

# Announcement
Due to some technical and personal issues the project will be delayed for a while
